# Bottom-Sea-Detection

## Abstract

Terabytes of acoustic multispectral data are routinely collected by oceanographic vessel on fisheries resources campaign assessment in West African waters. The vessel sends out pulses of various frequencyâ€™s acoustic waves in the water, those waves are reflected back to the source when they meet diverse organisms (fish, plankton, etc) or more generally solid objects. We call echogram (echo more informally) the corresponding signal. Since there is a large variety of elements interfering with the acoustic signal it is hard (we rely on the work of experts) to interpret and identify the various organisms that are found by this procedure. Nowadays bottom sea recognition is still partially done by experts in a semi automated approach. The overall goal of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of deep learning methods to automate the task of bottom sea estimation.
